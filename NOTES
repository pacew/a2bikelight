except pads should be 0.6 mm long instead of 1.5
and there should be a 3.45 square in the middle

when using the QFP footprint wizard, "horizontal spacing" is the
center to center distance between the left and right columns of pads.
the datasheet says 5.3 from outside to outside of pad, and the pads
are .6, so 5.3 - .6/2 - .6/2 = 4.7
